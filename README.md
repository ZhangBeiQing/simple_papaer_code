# Simplified Paper Implementations

## Project Goal

This project aims to provide simplified implementations of research papers. While many original authors release their code, it often includes complex distributed, parallel, or framework-specific code that can obscure the core innovations of the paper for readers.

This project addresses this challenge by simplifying the implementations based on the original papers and the authors' public code. All complex distributed, parallel, and framework-specific code has been removed to offer the most straightforward replications of the papers' core ideas.

## Implemented Papers

Currently, the following papers have been implemented:

1.  **`Absolute Zero Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data.py`**: Corresponds to the paper "Absolute Zero Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data" https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335
2.  **`LUFFY.py`**: Corresponds to the paper "Learning to Reason under OFF-Policy guidance"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14945
3.  **`GRPO.py`**: Based on the implementation found at [https://github.com/aburkov/theLMbook](https://github.com/aburkov/theLMbook).
